Notes:
- colors must match to connect
- red arrow means bad connection
- underlines mean things can change - this is weird

Issues/Suggestions:
- Walkthrough/tutorial/suggestor with opt-out option for new users at the beginning?
- Clarify error message language
  - Block names could be simplified to one line - 
  - Can't manipulate boxes while viewing errors
  - Also, what is the meaning of orange, purple, and green fields in box menus? Does this make sense?
  - Why is arrow red? Where is the error here? Need to clarify. If we shouln't connect, we shouldn't be able to connect
  - When you click in the box, it displays errors but they are not labeled as errors
- Menu should include a persistent seach box
- Grey-out unusable menu option / red or bold things you MUST HAVE for it to work
- Include some kind of legend for color-coding
- Revise hover-descriptions/clarify language
- Streamline & revise top menu icons
- Kill/Execute too close together
- Can we make any part of this interaction step-by-step?
- Needs to indicate whether the element is linkable or add-on
- Sprout arrows to indicate connections
- Search looks like a magnifying glass
- Why is there no zoom in/out?
- Why are there two X's?? One deletes an element and one CLOSES the flowgraph.



- What is the purpose of import math? Is this specific to our project? Why is it not automatic?
*Not sure if VB or GNU problem - but it is difficult to open files from within GRC
